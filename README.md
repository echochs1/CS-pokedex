# Pokedex and Box
##Goal
- The goal is to build a functional web app using all the technologies we've learned
- Use Express to build backend routers for the / page, and the /pokemonStats page
- Use middleware to fetch the pokemon stats data for the pokemonStats page when rerouted with a given ID
- Use React to create components for both the home and stats page
- Use test driven development to build website

##Extensions
- Create a database holding user information
- create a login and sign up page using bcrypt and OAuth
- use cookies and sessions to maintain login
- create a PC page to hold saved pokemon for each user. Each pokemon should have personalized movesets and stats
- Give CRUD functionality to the database
